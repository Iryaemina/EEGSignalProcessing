# EEG Signal Processing



This repository contains tools and techniques for processing and analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Whether you're a researcher, student, or developer working in the field of neuroscience or machine learning, this repository aims to assist you in analyzing EEG recordings and extracting valuable insights from brainwave data.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Scripts and functions for cleaning, filtering, and artifact removal from EEG data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods for extracting relevant features from EEG signals, including spectral analysis, time-frequency analysis, and statistical measures.
- **Classification**: Algorithms and models for classifying EEG signals into different states or conditions, such as seizure detection, sleep stage classification, or cognitive state recognition.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing EEG data, including raw signal plots, spectrograms, and topographic maps.

## Installation

To use the EEG signal processing tools in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EEGSignalProcessing.git
